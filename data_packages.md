# Data Packages

We adapted this concept from Open Knowledge International's [Data Package](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) specification, which allows us to package metadata with data files. 

We chose to provide metadata in [YAML](http://yaml.org/) instead of JSON format, as YAML is both human- and machine-readable. 

When users download a dataset from **Data.gov.s[]()g**, the zip file contains:
- A metadata text file (in YAML syntax)
- The resource file(s)
