# Data.gov.sg Data Quality Guide for Tabular Data

## Introduction

**Data.gov.sg** was launched in 2011 as the Singapore government's [open data](http://opendatahandbook.org/guide/en/what-is-open-data/) portal. To date, 70 government agencies have published data on the portal. 

In 2014, we started on a revamp of the site to make our data:

1. More relevant to the general public
2. More usable for researchers, developers and other power users. 

To meet these requirements, we drafted a new set of *data quality standards* to ensure *all* published data can be:

1. Visualised in charts and maps
2. Accessible via APIs

The new **Data.gov.s[]()g** was launched in October 2015. All published datasets can be accessed via CKAN APIs, and almost all datasets are visualised so users can understand trends at a glance.

**All datasets must meet these data quality requirements before publication on Data.gov.sg**.
